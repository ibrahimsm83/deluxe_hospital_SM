Flutter Success: Designing 50+ Screens in Just 6 Days!â€¨
Thrilled to announce a recent milestone: Over the course of a mere six days, I meticulously designed and delivered more than 50 screens, faithfully replicating the Figma designs, using the Flutter framework. This intensive project culminated in the successful delivery to a satisfied client. Demonstrating the efficacy and efficiency of Flutter, I take pride in contributing to the seamless realization of our client's vision.
